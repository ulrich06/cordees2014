## Introduction

### Welcome
First at all, we would like to welcome you to "Cordées de la Réussite 2014-2015" program! This program is aimed to _(i)_ give you an overview of the higher education studies in computer science and electronics and to _(ii)_ experience the challenges tackled by engineers.

During the following weeks, you will face a __"real use-case"__ problem. This problem will be analysed, broken-down and finally a solution will be modeled, simulated and implemented.

All the tutors are either engineers, engineer students or M.sc students and are pleased to support you. Once again, welcome and have fun!

### Pre-requisites
* Work in __teams of 2__ (exceptionally 3) pupils
* __One computer__ per group (Keep the same computer accross the different sessions)
* __Be on time__, the world won't wait for you

## Project proposal
### Context
You recently have been hired _(congratulations!)_ by a start-up company specialised in the analysis and the engineering of IoT[^1] problems.
[^1]: Internet Of Things

The project assigned to your team is to design a digital temperature/humidity sensor to the automobile industry. These sensors have to collect data on the current weather parameters and send them over the Internet. Then, meteorologists can analyse those data to accurately their weather forecast.

As you are a junior engineer, your manager also wishes you to attend a training on the electronic design.

### Arduino board
#### Introduction
__ARDUINO__ is an open-source hardware based on a (re-)programable micro-controller. This platform is based on input/output interactions and allows a user to analysis and produce analog or digital signals. 

This Arduino board is built on a pre-programmed Atmel AVR micro-controller. To work with this micro-controller, we provide you a SDK[^2] for writting code and compile it. The result of the compilation process is loaded into the micro-controller thanks to an USB connection.
